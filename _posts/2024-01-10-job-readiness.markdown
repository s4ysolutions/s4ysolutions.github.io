## Preferences

I prefer project-based work, where the goals and completion criteria are clearly defined,
along with specific timelines and budgets. Alternatively, I am open to working under a permanent
contract with a product company that owns and uses the product being developed.

I am also open to opportunities in outsourcing companies, provided there is a project owner
who possesses all the necessary information and can make decisions regarding the approach to
solving problems.

## Best position

I thrive as a member of relatively small teams, ideally practicing pair programming and XP
(Extreme Programming) methodologies. I excel as a technical expert within the team, without
the need for a team lead role.

I am passionate about the test automation process and open to opportunities as a
Test Automation Engineer for Android applications.

For projects with limited budgets, I can work as a solo developer during the development phase,
with the option to bring in a replacement developer or hire part-time for the maintenance phase.

Additionally, I had good experience working with legacy codebases lacking the documentation and
can help with refactoring and modernization of such projects.

## Salary expectations

Given the tough job market, I need to be realistic about my salary expectations and remain open
to the position of Middle Android Developer(Kotlin/Flutter) despite my Senior Software Developer
experience.

A Middle Kotlin Backend Developer position is also possible.

Additionally, I want to enhance my experience as a GoLang backend developer, and I am willing to work
in a Junior Developer position for up to one year.

## Availability

In the moment of writing this document, I am available for a new job.
 
 - on-site in Novi Sad, Serbia
 - hybrid (on-site/remote) in any city of Serbia
 - remote worldwide

Feel free to reach out to me using any of the links at the bottom of the page. I am open to discussing opportunities
and can provide my CV upon request.
